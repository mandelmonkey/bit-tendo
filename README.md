# bit-tendo
Add bitcoin to retro game consoles

The project is still in prototyping phase so code will be pushed here when the experimental stuff is done.
The project does not require the user to alter or mod the game/console in anyway
It analyzes the video output feed and interprets events such as level start, get coin etc
